Blood Sample Collection for Biobank\nObjective: To study biology of blast crisis CML (genetic, epigenetic, proteomic, metabolomic etc.) and assess drug sensitivity/insensitivity.\nChronic myeloid leukaemia provides several tractable clinical and laboratory characteristics that allow us to study response to therapy at a clonal level \u2013 particularly the ability to grow colonies which contain sufficient numbers of cells for simultaneous genotyping and phenotypic analyses. Blood samples collected in this study will also be used to undertake genome-wide characterisation of patient-specific features that determine response and resistance to therapy. It is proposed to use respectively high-throughput sequencing, transcriptional profiling (at clonal level), epigenetic approaches and signalling studies to characterise patient-specific factors that determine response to therapy. By focusing on samples from patients in a prospective clinical trial and integrating results, genome-wide insights into the patient-specific genetic and epigenetic factors that determine response to treatment can be achieved.\nAll projects requesting cells from the Biobank will require approval from the NCRI CML Working Party before samples can be released to the researcher. \n\n2. Buccal Cell Sample collection for Biobank\nObjective: To study biology of blast crisis CML (genetic, epigenetic, proteomic, metabolomic etc)\nA sample of buccal cells will be requested at baseline. If this sample proves insufficient to analyse, a further sample of constitutional DNA (hair follicle) will be requested at a later date if the patient consents. \nThis sample should be shipped to the Biobank with the baseline blood. \nAll projects requesting cells from the Biobank will require approval from the NCRI CML Working Party before samples can be released to the researcher.",

      "E.5.1 Primary end point(s)": "Tolerability; Identification of the dose of ponatinib that can be safely delivered in combination with chemotherapy (FLAG-IDA) is defined in terms of dose limiting toxicities.\nDose Limiting Toxicity will be defined as:\n\u2022\tBefore the start of the second cycle of combination therapy or up to 8 weeks from the start of the first cycle of combination therapy, whichever is sooner: \no\tGrade 3 or 4 clinically significant non-haematological toxicity that cannot be managed with optimal medical care and that in the opinion of the investigator is related to the ponatinib and is likely to endanger the life of the patient or result in long term effects\no\tPancreatitis grade 2 or above\no\tIncreased serum  amylase grade 3 or 4*\no\tProlongation of the QT interval grade 3 or 4\no\tMyocardial infarction\no\tStroke\no\tDevelopment or progression of a thromboembotic event requiring revascularisation\no\tUnprovoked venous thromboembolism \n\n\u2022\tToxicities will be measured and graded according to Version 4 CTCAE criteria.\n\n*In cases where the patient displays an increased serum amylase level but no clinical signs of pancreatitis, please test the pancreatic isoenzyme level to differentiate between pancreatic and salivary amylase levels. If the pancreatic amylase level is within the ULN but the salivary amylase level is not, this would not be classified as a DLT and treatment may continue. Similarly, some ethnic populations, particularly African individuals may display a high normal level of amylase due to salivary amylase as opposed to pancreatic amylase. It is recommended to test isoenzyme levels to confirm if this is the case.\n\nEfficacy: Haematological response (HR) or cytogenetic response (CyR) \nHR is defined as achieving all the following criteria:\nPlatelets >50x10^9/L (unsupported)\nNeutrophils >1.0 x10^9/L (unsupported)\nBlasts < 5% peripheral blood and bone marrow (where assessable)\n\nCyR is defined as achieving at least a minor cytogenetic response (i.e. <65 % Ph+ cells)\n\nAn assessment for the primary outcome measure must be conducted prior to commencing the 2nd cycle of therapy. This can be at any time from 4-8 weeks after commencing combination therapy following haematological recovery to at least neutrophils \u22651.0x10^9/L and Platelets \u2265 50 x10^9/L. An assessment should be carried out at 8 weeks after commencing combination therapy if haematological recovery is not achieved.  \nGiven the heterogeneity of blast crisis CML and the advanced stage of disease, there may be instances of DLTs or reports of efficacy (as defined above) that occur outside of the 8 week period. If such events occur outside of the 8 week period but prior to the TSC meeting being conducted, the events will be formally reported to the TSC to take into consideration during their review of each patient. \n\nCumulative reports of safety and efficacy from previously enrolled patients will also be reported to the TSC for consideration.\n\nPatients who are unable to be formally evaluated for tolerability and efficacy due to withdrawal, treatment discontinuation or death, that is unrelated to treatment, before commencing the second cycle of therapy, may be replaced depending on the nature of the withdrawal/discontinuation. The trials office will notify centres of any patient replacement.\n\nIf a patient is evaluable for the tolerability outcome but not the efficacy outcome, the efficacy outcome may be inferred, as described in Section 12.1.1.1.",

      "E.2.1 Main objective of the trial": "The main research question is to evaluate the effect of Calcitriol treatment as compared to placebo on left ventricular mass in patients with type 2 diabetes, left ventricular hyperthrophy and chronic kidney disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy is a marker and predictor of cardiovascular disease risk. Left ventricular mass will be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Interventions that reduce left ventricular hypertrophy may prevent cardiovascular disease.\nCurrently it is not known if treatment with Calcitriol can affect left ventricular mass in patients with diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy and kidney disease. We wish to study the effect of Calcitriol or placebo as add on treatment to existing medical treatments on left ventricular mass in a placebo controlled double blind study. Patients will continue with other medical treatments for their diabetes and kidney disease.",
      "E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial": "Secondary research questions will be to evaluate the effect of Calcitriol treatment as compared to placebo on interstitial myocardial fibrosis. Other secondary questions will be to compare the effect of calcitriol and placebo on augmentation left ventricular end-systolic volume, left ventricular end diastolic volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, pulse wave velocity by MRI, and if no contraindication exists cardiac perfusion. Similar to the left ventricular mass measurements all these determinations are also non invasive. Other secondary endpoints questions include blood pressure, pulse wave velocity by applanation tonometry, kidney function as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate, changes in calcium and phosphate levels in the blood and hormones involved in regulating bone metabolism and blood pressure and quality of life as measured by a questionnaire.",

History of any of the following excludes subject participation in the study: chronic infection particularly HIV or Hepatitis B or C; cancer other than basal cell cancer less than five years prior, or other chronic serious medical illnesses.\n2. Presence of any of the following on routine blood screening: WBC < 3000; platelets < 100,000; hematocrit < 30%; BUN > 30 mg; creatinine > 1.5 x upper limit of normal; symptomatic liver disease with serum albumin < 30mg/dl\n3. History of most recent creatine kinase >15x the upper limit of normal without any other explanation besides IBM.\n4. History of non-compliance with other therapies.\n5. Use of testosterone except for physiologic replacement doses in case of androgen deficiency. Participants must have documented proof of the androgen deficiency.\n6. Coexistence of any other disease that would likely to affect outcome measures.\n7. Drug or alcohol abuse within past three months. Patient has recent history (within 6 months before Screening) of chronic alcohol or drug abuse which may compromise the patient\u2019s safety or ability to participate in study activities. Cannabis for IBM symptoms will be allowed (where legal).\n8. Participation in a recent drug study in the last 30 days prior to the screening visit or use of biologic agents less than 6 months prior to the screening visit.\n9. Women who are lactating or pregnant, or sexually active female subjects of child-bearing potential* intending to become pregnant or unwilling to use a highly effective method of contraception** during the trial through 1 month after the last dose of trial medication. Sexually active males with female partners of child-bearing potential* unwilling to use a condom with or without spermicide in addition to the birth control used by their partners during the trial until 3 months after the last dose of trial medication unless surgically sterile (vasectomy). \nNon child-bearing potential is defined as post-menopausal (minimum of 12 months with no menses and follicle-stimulating hormone in the post-menopausal range) or sterilisation (hysterectomy, oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation). \n** Highly effective methods of contraception include combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal); progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, or implantable); intrauterine device; intrauterine hormone-releasing system; bilateral tubal occlusion; and vasectomised partner. \nAccording to the recommendations from the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG, 2014), sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective birth control method only if it is defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the trial until 1 month after the last dose of trial medication (for female subjects of child-bearing potential) and for 3 months after the last dose of trial medication (for male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential). The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated by the investigator in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. \n10. Participants taking >7.5 mg prednisolone or equivalent or participants on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or other immunosuppressants within the last 3 months. Topical, nasal, and ocular corticosteroids are allowed unless they are being widely applied or the severity of the underlying condition makes them unsuitable in the Investigator\u2019s opinion. Local steroid injections are allowed.\n11. Clinically significant renal or hepatic disease, as indicated by clinical laboratory assessment (results \u22653 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] for alanine aminotransferase combined with bilirubin \u22652 times the ULN; symptomatic liver disease with serum albumin < 3 g/dL; or creatinine \u22651.5 times the ULN).

The primary null hypothesis is that there is no difference in TST2/3 between subjects receiving tasimelteon and subjects receiving placebo. TST2/3 will be assessed by analysis of covariance, with treatment group, clinical site, baseline and time zone as a main effect. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the ITT population.\nIf the primary null hypothesis is rejected at an alpha level of 0.05, then the step-down primary null hypothesis will also be tested at an alpha level of 0.05 to assess the efficacy of tasimelteon versus placebo as measured by the reduction in the proportion of patients with disturbed sleep on the worst night. The step-down primary endpoint will be summarized and analyzed by a two-sided unconditional exact test, Barnard\u2019s exact test. The ITT population will be used in this analysis.\nThe Step-down Primary endpoint is to assess the effects of tasimelteon as measured by the reduction in the proportion of patients with disturbed sleep after transmeridian travel on the worst night.",

General Information on the Trial\nE.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation\nE.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a rare inherited red blood cell (RBC) disorder characterized by chronic hemolysis, debilitating pain, progressive multiorgan damage, and premature death. SCD is caused by a specific point mutation in the gene encoding hemoglobin subunit beta that results in the substitution of a hydrophobic valine residue for glutamic acid in the 6th position from the N-terminus of the beta-chain leading to the production of HbS.\nE.1.1.1 Medical condition in easily understood language: Sickle cell disease is a rare genetically inherited disease, which affects hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. \nE.1.1.2 Therapeutic area: Diseases [C] - Blood and lymphatic diseases [C15]\nMedDRA Classification\nE.1.2 Medical condition or disease under investigation:\nE.1.2 Version: 21.0\nE.1.2 Level: PT\nE.1.2 Classification code: 10040644\nE.1.2 Term: Sickle cell disease\nE.1.2 System Organ Class: 10010331 - Congenital, familial and genetic disorders\nE.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: Yes\nE.2 Objective of the trial\nE.2.1 Main objective of the trial: To assess the safety and tolerability of IMR-687 in adult patients with sickle cell anaemia (SCA), defined as homozygous sickle haemoglobin (HbSS) or sickle-\u03b20 thalassemia, who are not receiving hydroxyurea (HU) and in adult SCA patients who are receiving a stable dose of HU\nE.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: To characterise the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of IMR-687 in adult patients with SCA who are/are not receiving a stable dose of HU \n\nTo characterise the PK profile of HU in adult patients with SCA before and after receiving IMR 687 to determine if there is a clinically relevant PK interaction.\n\n\nE.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No\nE.3 Principal inclusion criteria: Each patient must meet all of the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:\n1. Male or female \u226518 or \u226450 years of age.\n2. Confirmed diagnosis of SCA (HbSS or sickle-B0 thalassemia). Note, if not already documented in the patient\u2019s record, the diagnosis of SCA must be confirmed via electrophoresis, HPLC, and/or genotyping. \n3. Use of HU:\n\u2022 For patients in the Population A:  Have not received HU within 90 days prior to Screening and are not planning to take HU within the next 6 months \n\u2022 For patients in Population B:  Have received HU for at least 6 months, have been on a stable dose for at least 60 days prior to Screening, and are not planning to change the dose level, dose regimen, or discontinue HU within the next 6 months. \n4. Female patients must not be pregnant and be highly unlikely to become pregnant. Male patients must be unlikely to impregnate a partner. Male or female patients must meet at least one of the following criteria:\n\u2022 A female patient who is not of reproductive potential is eligible without requiring the use of contraception. A female patient who is not of reproductive potential is defined as one who: (1) has reached natural menopause (defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea without an alternative medical cause, and can be confirmed with serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the postmenopausal range as determined by the local laboratory; (2) is 6 weeks post-surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy; or (3) has undergone bilateral tubal ligation. Spontaneous amenorrhea does not include cases for which there is an underlying disease that causes amenorrhea (i.e., anorexia nervosa).\n\u2022 A male patient who is not of reproductive potential is eligible without requiring the use of contraception. A male patient who is not of reproductive potential is defined as one who has undergone a successful vasectomy. A successful vasectomy is defined as (1) microscopic documentation of azoospermia, or (2) a vasectomy more than 2 years ago with no resultant pregnancy despite sexual activity post vasectomy.\n\u2022 A male or female patient who is of reproductive potential agrees to remain truly abstinent or use (or have their partner use) acceptable methods of highly effective contraception starting from the time of consent through 3 months after the completion of study therapy. True abstinence is defined as abstinence that is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of the trial and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Acceptable methods of highly effective birth control are combined or progestogen-only hormonal contraception that is associated with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine device, and intrauterine hormone-releasing system. \n5. Be capable of giving informed consent and reading and signing the informed consent form after the nature of the study has been fully explained by the investigator or investigator designee.\n6. Be willing and able to complete all study assessments and procedures and to communicate effectively with the investigator and site staff.\n\nE.4 Principal exclusion criteria: 1. Total Hb at Screening >12.5 g/dL or < 6 g/dL. \n2.Reticulocyte count <100 x 109/L for Population A; reticulocyte count <80 x 109/L for Population"

Diagnosed with T2DM with glucose control managed with any insulin and/or oral therapy combination where no significant dose changes of oral therapy of more than 50% have occurred in the 3 months prior to screening\n\n4. Body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 45 kg/m2 (inclusive) at screening\n\n5. HbA1c range of 6.5 % to 10.5% (inclusive) at screening\n\n6. Renal impairment with eGFR \u2265 30 and < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 at screening. At least 16 subjects (40%) are required to have a screening eGFR \u226530 and < 45 mL/min/1.73m2 and at least 16 subjects (40%) are required to have screening eGFR \u226545 and < 60 mL/min/1.73m2. eGFR will be determined by the chronic kidney disease-epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. In instances where the eGFR estimated during the screening period is outside the range expected from the subject\u2019s medical history, the subject may be re-tested once.\n\n7. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and randomisation, and must not be lactating. Women of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner must be using at least one highly effective method of contraception from screening and up to 4 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. It is strongly recommended for the male partner of a female subject to also use male condom plus spermicide throughout this period.

To supplement this, the IASO substudy will collect additional information about inflammatory pathways in the colon to help understand more about how and why anakinra treatment may work and so refine drug selection and usage. To do this, participants in the substudy will be asked to consent to a flexible sigmoidoscopy (camera examination of the last part of the large bowel) approximately 3 days after starting treatment, to allow for visual assessment of bowel damage and collection of biopsy material from the bowel.",

      "E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial": "In addition to the primary objective previously stated, we will address the following questions: \n1) Can a diagnostic synovial biopsy showing a B-cell \u201crich/poor pathotype\u201d define specific disease responsive/resistant subsets for patient stratification and help rationalize biologic drug choice? \n2) Is clinical response associated with inhibition of B cell-linked pathways within the synovium and dependent on local B cell lineage depletion? \n3) Is survival of auto-reactive B cells within \u201cprotected\u201d synovial niches responsible for B-cell joint re-population and disease resistance-relapse?\n\nFor the B-cell-rich synovial pathotypes, we aim to compare the treatment effects of Rituximab to the other two treatment options (Tocilizumab and Etanercept, treated together for analysis). Finally, we aim to examine the interaction between treatments and B-cell status (rich and poor).",

      "E.5.1.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point": "12 weeks (and 4 weeks)",
      "E.5.2 Secondary end point(s)": "Secondary outcome measures are specific tests of attention and performance of activities of daily living:\nTests of Attention\nTrails A and B\nThe trail-making test is one of the most widely used in neuropsychology. Both parts consist of 25 circles distributed\nover a sheet of paper. In Part A, the circles are numbered 1 \u2013 25, and the patient should draw lines to connect the\nnumbers in ascending order. In Part B, the circles include both numbers (1 \u2013 13) and letters (A \u2013 L); as in Part A, the\npatient draws lines to connect the circles in an ascending pattern, but with the added task of alternating between the\nnumbers and letters (i.e., 1-A-2-B-3-C, etc.). Results for both TMT A and B are reported as the number of seconds\nrequired to complete the task; therefore, higher scores reveal greater impairment.\nDigit-Symbol Substitution\nThe test requires the subject to transcribe a unique geometric symbol with its corresponding Arabic number. The\nexaminee is initially shown a key containing the numbers from 1 to 9. Under each number there is a corresponding\ngeometric symbol. It is scored by totaling the number of successful transcriptions during 60s, and is a measure of\nprocessing speed.\nTest of Everyday Attention-Map Search and Elevator Counting\nIn the map search subtest, which is a test of selective attention, participants search for symbols on a coloured map.\nThe score is the number out of 80 found in 2 minutes. This subtest is age-sensitive and usable with almost all braindamaged\npatients, including those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It measures selective attention.\nIn the \u2018Elevator Counting with Distraction\u2019 subtest, subjects have to count the low tones in a pretend elevator while\nignoring the high tones. This is a test of auditory selective attention.\nCANTAB-RVP\nTHE RVP (Rapid Visual Information Processing) component of the CANTAB computerised test battery is a test of\nsustained attention that lasts 10 minutes. A white box appears in the centre of the computer screen, inside which\ndigits, from 2 to 9, appear in a pseudo-random order, at the rate of 100 digits per minute. Participants are requested to\ndetect target sequences of digits (for example, 2-4-6, 3-5-7, 4-6-8) and to register responses using a press pad.\nCarer Input and Activities of Daily Living\nNeuropsychiatric Inventory\nThe Neuropsychiatric Inventory is a validated instrumented that was designed to detect the presence of\nneuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with dementia. It is based on responses from an informed caregiver,\npreferably one living with the patient. It is the most widely used behaviour instrument in clinical trials of treatments for\ndementia.\nZarit Burden Interview\nThis interview was specifically designed to assess the effects of dementia on caregivers. Each item on the interview is\na statement that the caregiver is asked to endorse using a 5-point scale. Response options range from 0 (Never) to 4\n(Nearly Always). We will employ the 22-point version of this interview.\nADCS-ADL\nThe ADCS-ADL is a measure of activities of daily living based on caregiver answers\nare measures of carer input and activities of daily living. We will employ the 23-item version (ADCS-ADL23), which\nincludes more complex ADL for the assessment of mild to moderate AD, such as reading books or magazines,\npastime activities, or household chores. Ratings take about 20 minutes and are based on information obtained from\nthe patient and caregiver. The scores range from 0 to 78, higher scores indicating less functional impairment.\nSafety Measures\nEpworth Sleepiness Scale\nThe Epworth sleepiness scale was designed to address daytime sleepiness. We will use a modified version of the\nscale to include responses from caregivers.\nSide Effect Questionnaire\nWe will ask patients and caregivers about a number of side effects that have been associated with GXR treatment.\nThese include dry mouth, headache and increased sleepiness.",

This leads to signs of ageing including the deterioration of organs such as the heart and a reduced ability of the immune system to fight infections and maintain overall health. One reason why cells age, is damage to the DNA that is contained inside them. DNA contains all of the information about how a cell will function, and can be thought of as a piece of string. At the ends of the DNA there are protective caps called telomeres that maintain the health of DNA. Cells need to divide in order to replace lost or dead cells, but during the process of dividing, some of the protective cap (telomeres) is lost and is not passed on to new cells. Therefore, throughout life, the length of the telomeres becomes shorter and this is linked to cell ageing and a decrease in cell health. \nThere is a product called TA-65MD\u00ae that has been shown",
      "E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial": "\u2022This study will also investigate the effect of TA-65MD\u00ae on the small blood vessels that play an important role in the health of the heart.\n\u2022We will investigate whether cytomegalovirus exposure in participants has an effect on the immune system or the heart\n\u2022Investigate the effect of TA-65MD\u00ae on overall inflammation levels\n\u2022Investigate the effect of TA-65MD\u00ae on heart strain/heart failure and how well the heart is functioning \n\u2022Investigate the effect of TA-65MD\u00ae on length of telomeres , as the way that TA-65MD\u00ae works is by making telomeres longer, we want to check that the length of telomeres is increased in people who take TA-65MD\u00ae.\n\u2022Investigate the effect of TA-65MD\u00ae on telomerase activity- as TA-65MD\u00ae is supposed to increase telomerase activity we want to check this\n\u2022We will look at the rates of adherence to the study drugs\n\u2022We will also look at the adverse events profile for both placebo and intervention arms",

      "E.4 Principal exclusion criteria": "\u2022\tPatients with any disorder associated with immunological dysfunction (acute or chronic inflammatory or neoplastic co-existing disease, known positive serology for HIV, or hepatitis)\n\u2022\tClinically unstable patients (haemodynamically unstable, cardiogenic shock, unconscious) \n\u2022\tSevere, uncontrolled hypertension (Blood Pressure >170/110mmHg, or ambulatory BP of 150/95mmHg);\n\u2022\tSevere comorbidity that has an impact on outcome over next 2 years\n\u2022\tTaking immunosuppressants\n\u2022\tKnown malignancy\n\u2022\tInsulin-controlled diabetes\n\u2022\tJudgment by the Investigator that the patient should not participate in the study, for example, if the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and requirements\n\u2022\tParticipation in any other interventional medicinal studies in the past 6 months",
      "E.5.1 Primary end point(s)": "Immunosenescence at 1 year following start of treatment with the study drug (TA-65MD\u00ae/placebo) will be determined by flow cytometry (FACS).  The proportion of terminally differentiated CD8+ effector memory cells (%CD8+ TEMRA 'aged') will be calculated from the total number of peripheral blood CD8+ T-lymphocytes in each blood sample.",
      "E.5.1.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point": "Baseline, 6 and 12 months",
      "E.5.2 Secondary end point(s)": "\u2022Leukocyte Telomere Length will be measured at baseline, 6 months and 1 year; short leukocyte telomere length is a predictor of cardiovascular mortality  \n\u2022CD8 T-cell telomere length will be measured at baseline, 6 months and 1 year; short telomere length is a predictor of cardiovascular mortality, and CD8 telomere length is significantly reduced in patients with coronary heart disease and post myocardial infarction. Isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be FACS sorted to purify CD8 cells.\n\u2022The proportion of senescent (CD28-) CD4+ T-lymphocytes will be measured at baseline, 6 months and 1 year and calculated from the total number of CD4+ T-lymphocytes in each PBMC sample. CD28- CD4+ T-lymphocytes have been shown to be significantly increased in patients with acute coronary syndrome\n\u2022The proportion of senescent (CD28-) CD8+ T-lymphocytes will be measured at baseline, 6 months and 1 year and calculated from the total number of CD8+ T-lymphocytes in each PBMC sample \n\u2022Microvascular Endothelial Function will be assessed by measuring flow-mediated dilation (FMD) using finger plethysmography (EndoPat) at baseline, 6 months and 1 year. Using plethysmography at the fingertips of both hands, the EndoPAT system (Itamar Medical Ltd., Caesarea, Israel) will calculate an index of pulse wave amplitude after cuff occlusion to before occlusion of the test arm divided by the same ratio of the control limb, namely the reactive hyperemic index (RHI). FMD has been shown to be compromised in patients with diabetes as well as with coronary artery disease. It is a predictor of adverse clinical outcome. Endothelial dysfunction is seen as the initial step in atherogenesis. \n\u2022Systemic Inflammation will be measured by high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) at baseline, 6 months and 12 months of treatment. We expect TA-65MD\u00ae to reduce systemic inflammation, and this should be reflected in a reduction in hsCRP.\n\u2022Heart failure and cardiac function will be assessed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) at baseline and 12 months of treatment, and the pronatriuretic peptide NT-proBNP biomarker at baseline, 6 months and 12 months of treatment. Together these measures will determine myocardial function, hypertrophy (left ventricular wall thickness), strain (NT-proBNP), and global longitudinal strain, reflecting the pathophysiological targets of heart failure. TA-65MD\u00ae may reduce NT-proBNP levels or improve left ventricular function. Lack of telomerase and shortened telomeres in cardiomyocytes from preclinical models (mice) have been shown to be critical in the development of heart failure in that species  \n\u2022Telomerase activity will be assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months following treatment using the TRAP assay. This provides an indication of drug effect: TA-65MD\u00ae is expected to increase telomerase activity in PBMCs.\n\u2022Oxidative stress will be measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months following treatment with the TBARS colorimetric assay (Oxford Biomedical Research) with frozen plasma. TBARS is an established assay to quantify lipid peroxides. Additionally, we will evaluate whether treatment with TA-65MD\u00ae leads to parallel activation of canonical and non-canonical pathways. By measuring oxidative stress and endothelial function over time and correlating this with telomere length dynamics and telomerase activity.\n\u2022The effect of CMV seropositivity at baseline will be correlated with study outcomes using an exploratory analysis. We have previously shown that individuals who are seropositive have a much higher proportion of CD8+ TEMRA cells and have a greater risk of heart attacks  \n\u2022Adherence to the study drugs will be determined by pill counts at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months\n\u2022Adverse events will be recorded from the time of randomisation to withdrawal or the last study visit. All cause death, stroke and myocardial infarction will also be combined to provide a composite outcome.",

As a minimum patients must have failed one or more lines of treatment (either radiological documentation of disease progression or due to toxicity). \n\u2022 Patients who have progressed after surgical resection and adjuvant therapy will be eligible for entry without the need for the administration of first line metastatic therapy if they have progressed within 6 months of completing their adjuvant treatment.\n\u2022 Patients will also be eligible without the necessity for first line regimen if they have relapsed within 6 months of completion of definitive chemoradiation.\n\u2022 Consented and provided an adequate specimen to adequately characterise the molecular genotype of the tumour in the molecular pre-screening according to the molecular exclusion rules (see protocol for definition of an adequate sample).\n\u2022 Histological or cytologically confirmed NSCLC stage III (not suitable for radical radiotherapy or surgery) or stage IV. This includes patients who may have abnormal histology, but IHC strongly support either squamous cell carcinoma (p63 positivity) or adenocarcinoma (Thyroid transcription factor 1 [TTF1] positivity). If a physician and pathologist are convinced after multi-disciplinary review that the patient has stage III or IV NSCLC but where all the IHC is negative and the morphology does not distinguish a specific sub-type, these patients will be eligible for non-histology specific cohorts.\n\u2022 CT scan of head, chest and abdomen within 28 days of treatment demonstrating measurable disease as per RECIST version 1.1.\n\u2022 Adequate haematological function within 7 days of treatment.\n  o Haemoglobin \u2265 90 g/L.\n  o Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/L.\n  o Platelets \u2265 100 x 109/L.\n\u2022Adequate hepatic function within 7 days of treatment in patients with no liver metastasis (see arm specific entry criteria for adequate hepatic function in patients with liver metastases).\n  o Total serum bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN).\n  o Alanine transferase (ALT) \u2264 2.5 x ULN. \n  o Aspartate transferase (AST) \u2264 2.5 x ULN. \n\u2022 Adequate renal function within 7 days of treatment.\n  o Creatinine clearance (CLcr) >50 ml/min (measured or calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation).\n\u2022 Age \u2265 18 years.\n\u2022 Females must agree to use adequate contraceptive measures (as defined in protocol section 6.3), should not be breast feeding and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing if of child-bearing potential or must have evidence of non-child-bearing potential by fulfilling one of the following criteria at screening:\n  o Post-menopausal defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments\n  o Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilisation by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation.\n  o Women aged under 50 years old would be consider postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and with luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution.\n\u2022 Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific procedures, sampling and analyses.\n\nArm-specific eligibility criteria also apply as detailed in the protocol.

Screening for chronic conditions is not required.\n\u2022 Pregnant or breast-feeding women.\n\nArm-specific eligibility criteria also apply as detailed in the protocol. Cardiac exclusion criteria are detailed within the arm-specific eligibility criteria.",
      "E.5.1 Primary end point(s)": "The trial design for each drug-biomarker cohort is essentially the same but the primary outcome measure representing signal of activity and the values that determine the go/no-go decision at interim and final analysis may differ across the different cohorts.\n\nThe primary outcome measure for trial Arms A, B, D, E, F & G is Best Objective Response Rate (ORR):\nPatients will have CT scans every 6 weeks from baseline until disease progression. On each occasion, overall tumour burden will be assessed using RECIST version 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al. 2009). Best response is the best response recorded over the whole period of assessment and could be complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD) or inevaluable for response (for which reasons such as early death due to disease or early death due to toxicity will be specified). Best objective response rate (ORR) will be calculated as the proportion of patients with CR or PR based on a denominator that includes all eligible patients that have received at least one cycle of treatment. Best objective response rate will be based on responses confirmed using the subsequent 6-weekly scan but best objective response rate based on unconfirmed responses will also be reported.\n\nBest percentage change in sum of target lesion diameters (PCSD):\nAt each evaluation, the longest diameters of all selected target lesions will be measured and summed and the percentage change from the baseline measurement will be calculated. The best percentage change is the one that reflects either the greatest decrease or the least increase over the whole period of assessment.\n\n\nThe primary outcome measure for trial Arm C is Progression Free Survival (PFS):\nPFS is defined as the time from registration into trial to the date of CT scan when progressive disease first recorded or date of death without previously recorded progression. Patients who are alive with no recorded progression at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of the CT scan when they were last recorded with an evaluable measure that was not progression.\n\nThe primary outcome measure for trial Arm NA is Best Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Progression Free Survival at 6 months (PFS6).",
      "E.5.1.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point": "The Bayesian adaptive trial design allows interim analysis at any point in the trial but a formal interim analysis is planned per cohort after 15 patients have been recruited in each drug-putative biomarker cohort at which decisions to stop recruitment early to the cohort for futility will be made based on the posterior probability distribution at that time. \n\nPrimary analysis of primary end points for the study will be performed at interim analysis (when 15 patients have been recruited into each cohort) and following the recruitment of 30 patients into each cohort.",
      "E.5.2 Secondary end point(s)": "Time to progression (TTP) - This is defined as the time from registration into trial to the date of CT scan when progressive disease first recorded. Patients with no recorded progression at the time of analysis or who die without recorded progression will be censored at the date of the CT scan when they were last recorded with an evaluable measure that was not progression. \n\nOverall survival time (OS) - This is defined as the time from registration into trial to the date of death. Patients who are alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the date last seen alive. \n\nToxicity - Adverse events will be recorded in relation to each cycle of treatment and graded according to CTCAE criteria (see Appendix 5). The incidence of each adverse event (all grades and grade 3/4) will be reported as a per-patient-cycle rate and as a per-patient rate.",
