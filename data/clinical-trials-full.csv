Women of childbearing potential and men receiving the study treatment and their partners must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method during the study and for 6 months (180 days) after end of study or early termination. Contraception should be in place at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment. Women must be surgically sterile or if of childbearing potential must use a highly effective contraceptive method. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will enter the study after confirmed menstrual period and a negative pregnancy test. Highly effective methods of contraception include true abstinence, intrauterine device (IUD) or hormonal contraception aiming at inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine hormone releasing system, bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomized partner. True abstinence is defined when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. In each case of delayed menstrual period (over one month between menstruation) confirmation of absence of pregnancy is required. This recommendation also applies to WOCBP with infrequent or irregular menstrual cycle. Female and male patients must not be planning pregnancy during the trial and for 6 months post completion of their participation in the trial. In addition, male patients should use condom during the trial and for 6 months (180 days) post completion of their participation in the study. Male patients must not donate sperm as long as contraception is required. For the purpose of this protocol, a woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a\npost-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Finally a man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.\n6.
